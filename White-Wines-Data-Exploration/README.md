# White Wines Exploration by Jeff Hartl
## Udacity Exploratory Data Analysis with R
### Final Project  
Project 4 in Data Analyst Nanodegree

### Contents  

**explore_your_data.R**
* A sort of "scratch pad" of trial-and-error R code I tinkered with while putting together the project.
Quite a bit of this code wound up in the final RMarkdown code I wrote ("P4_White_Wines_Data_Exploration.Rmd).
Quite a bit of it was in the RMarkdown file at one time, and later removed as I edited and refined it.

**P4_White_Wines_Data_Exploration.Rmd**
* The main project code. Can be viewed in browser or as raw code.

**Project Instructions - Explore and Summarize Data.md**
* Details about the structure, parameters, and goals of this assigned project.

**Udacity Reviews P4.pdf**
* Graded review and feedback on project by Udacity reviewer.

**wine project reference list.md**
* A list of key sources I used during my work on this project.
